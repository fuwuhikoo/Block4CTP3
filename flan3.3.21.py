Use this document to record your answers to the Parson's Problems
shared in class.

Remember: the idea behind a Parson's Problem is that you are
shown completely correct code that is presented OUT OF ORDER.
When arranged correctly, the code does what the Parson's Problem
says it should do.

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #2 below:

#Write your answer to Parson's Problem #3 below:

#basic conditional
x = input("Type a number")
